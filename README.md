# Iris Flower Type Prediction

This repository contains a deep learning model for predicting the type of Iris flower using TensorFlow and the Iris dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be found here: [Iris Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris). It consists of measurements of different Iris flower species and is commonly used for classification tasks.

## Features
The dataset includes the following features:
- **Sepal Length** (cm)
- **Sepal Width** (cm)
- **Petal Length** (cm)
- **Petal Width** (cm)
- **Species** (Target Variable: Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

## Model and Approach
The model is built using the following steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Normalizing feature values and encoding categorical labels.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding feature distributions and relationships.
3. **Deep Learning Model**: Implementing a neural network using TensorFlow.
4. **Training the Model**: Using techniques such as batch normalization and dropout for optimization.
5. **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance with accuracy, loss, and confusion matrices.

## Results
The trained model achieved an accuracy of **92%**, effectively classifying the three Iris species.

## Future Improvements
- Experimenting with different neural network architectures.
- Hyperparameter tuning for improved performance.
- Deploying the model in a web or mobile application.
